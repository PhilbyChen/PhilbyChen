## Hey there 👋
This is Zhiyuan Chen (or you can call me Philby)

## Basic Info 
I am a current undergraduate student majoring in Land Resources Management at SDAU.

BUT I **DO NOT** like this major,

I like **Physics**, **Aerospace** and **Astronomy!** 

I hope to be able to enter these fields when I progress to the master's degree stage.

But I am so clumpsy. Sometimes I feel like I’m not smart enough for them.
